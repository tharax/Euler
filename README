Solutions to ProjectEuler.net problems

Satisfying my need to work on, and solve, complex algorithms. Some of the original answers have been revisited to improve algorithm runtimes.

Long term my intention is to have one build file that compiles all the solutions into one file, which then offers to run all solutions.

Until then, if you want to run a completed solution, for each solution running "go run $file" should work.
